# ✅ Grok 4 Intelligence Testing Workflow - COMPLETED

## 🎯 **Mission Accomplished**

Successfully created a comprehensive intelligence testing framework for xAI's Grok models with advanced scoring algorithms and detailed performance analytics.

## 📋 **Workflow Status**

### ✅ **Primary Workflow**: Grok 4 Intelligence Testing Suite
- **ID**: `QjSc7YdP7lWlEJu4`
- **Model**: `x-ai/grok-4` (correct model ID)
- **Status**: Ready for execution when rate limits clear
- **Issue**: Temporarily rate-limited upstream (429 error)

### ✅ **Alternative Workflow**: Grok 3 Intelligence Testing Suite  
- **ID**: `cbUsMHNovEpaeLXx`
- **Model**: `x-ai/grok-3` (working and tested)
- **Status**: Ready for immediate execution
- **Test**: Verified working with API call

## 🧠 **Testing Framework Features**

### **5 Comprehensive Test Categories (100 points total):**

1. **Logical Reasoning (25 points)**
   - Syllogism analysis with logical fallacy detection
   - Mathematical word problems requiring step-by-step reasoning
   - Parallel vs sequential processing understanding
   - **Scoring**: Detects keywords like "cannot conclude", "insufficient information"

2. **Creative Problem Solving (25 points)**
   - Classic elevator puzzle (height/reach solution)
   - 3D spatial reasoning (cake cutting problem)
   - Novel scenario generation and problem-solving
   - **Scoring**: Looks for creative insights like "height", "short", "reach", "umbrella"

3. **Structured Output (25 points)**
   - JSON schema compliance testing
   - Business analysis with specific data structure requirements
   - Error handling for malformed responses
   - **Scoring**: Validates JSON parsing and required schema fields

4. **Context Reasoning (15 points)**
   - Multi-metric business scenario analysis
   - Strategic priority identification from complex data
   - Cross-referencing multiple data points
   - **Scoring**: Keyword detection for business concepts (retention, cost, growth, etc.)

5. **Metacognitive Assessment (10 points)**
   - Self-confidence rating (1-10 scale)
   - Reasoning about reasoning quality
   - Uncertainty acknowledgment
   - **Scoring**: Detects confidence ratings and self-assessment language

## 📊 **Advanced Scoring Algorithm**

### **Grade Scale:**
- **A+ (90-100%)**: Exceptional performance across all domains
- **A (80-89%)**: Strong performance, suitable for complex tasks  
- **B+ (70-79%)**: Good performance, reliable for most applications
- **B (60-69%)**: Adequate performance, consider task-specific usage
- **C (50-59%)**: Variable performance, use with caution
- **D (<50%)**: Poor performance, consider alternatives

### **Performance Analytics:**
- **Strengths**: Categories with 80%+ performance
- **Areas for Improvement**: Categories with <60% performance  
- **Consistency Rating**: Variance analysis across categories
- **Technical Depth**: Response complexity assessment

## 🔧 **Technical Specifications**

### **API Integration:**
- **Endpoint**: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`
- **Authentication**: Bearer token (your OpenRouter API key)
- **Model IDs**: 
  - Grok 4: `x-ai/grok-4` 
  - Grok 3: `x-ai/grok-3`
- **Parameters**: Temperature 0.3, Max tokens 2000

### **Error Handling:**
- Rate limit detection and reporting
- Invalid JSON response handling  
- Timeout protection (30 seconds)
- Graceful degradation for partial responses

## 🚀 **How to Execute**

### **Option 1: n8n Interface (Recommended)**
1. Open n8n at `http://localhost:5555`
2. Find "Grok 3 Intelligence Testing Suite (Alternative)" 
3. Click "Execute Workflow"
4. Review comprehensive results

### **Option 2: Try Grok 4 Later**
1. Wait for rate limits to clear (usually 1-60 minutes)
2. Execute "Grok 4 Intelligence Testing Suite"
3. Compare results between Grok 3 and Grok 4

### **Option 3: API Testing**
```bash
# Test if Grok 4 is available
curl -X POST "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "x-ai/grok-4", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "test"}]}'
```
